STM32F3Discovery ChibiOS Demo with Gyro and USB-CDC
---------------------------------------------------

An amalgamation of ChibiOS demo projects designed to run on the STM32F3Discovery board. Demonstrates reading from the onboard L3GD20 gyroscope over SPI
and output through the ChibiOS USB-CDC driver. Once ChibiOS supports I2C on the STM32F3, the goal is to read from the LSM303DLHC and implement
IMU/AHRS algorithms.


Setup
-----

Update the CHIBIOS variable in the Makefile to the location of the (Head, from SVN or Git) ChibiOS repository.


Build
-----

    make


Program
-------

I use [stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink), with the board plugged into the USB ST-LINK port.

    {sudo} st-flash write build/stm32f3discovery-demo.bin 0x8000000

Use
---

Connect to the USB USER port.

    {sudo} cat /dev/ttyACM0

You should see 3 floating point values corresponding to the x, y, and z rotational rates from the gyro.
